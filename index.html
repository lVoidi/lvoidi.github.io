  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
  I'm just a curious programmer, i like to build and rebuild stuff. I like contributing to open source code and 
  i always try to open source myself. I always try to keep my github green squares, but sometimes i can't open source 
  my code or i'm working on something else. 

  Apart from coding, i like to play bass, read and listening to music in general. I'm a computer engineering student.
  </p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
  I use to build with window managers like awesome and qtile. I like to open source my university projects also. I also try to 
  add unit tests and dockerfiles to my projects. I am part of Aerospacial Engineering groups in university, i like to build 
  rockets using openrocket.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Rover poas: This is one of the projects i'm currently working in, with a lot of people. It's a rover robot that can be remotely 
    controlled using radio signals, and has a camera integrated and also can take samples from vulcans (that's why it is called rover poas)
    </li>
    <li>
      Intellihome: This is one of the university projects i'm proud of, it is a SaaS web application made using python and django. It can connect 
      to a raspberry pi. It is a house renting system, but the houses are intelligent. So you can pair a house with devices connected to a raspberry pi. 
      We simulated lights with leds, gates with a servo motor and alarms with a buzzer. All of that conected wirelessly. The SaaS is very complete in functionality 
      and we are very proud of it as a group (the project was in groups of four people). We scored 90%. 
    </li>
    <li>
      TinySQL: This is a kind of SQL replica, it can parse sql sentences from scripts and persist in disk. It stores indices as Binary Trees or B-Trees. It is 
      proven that trees searches are faster than linear searches. We scored 100%.
    </li>
    <li>
      CEFootV4: This is a football game that can only be played using the circuit. It simulates penalties. It is a hand made mini stadium, where the goal is a 
      group of 6 buttons. Two or three of those buttons are selected randomly as the "goalie". There are two parts, the circuit side, which was the hardest, because 
      we hard to connect a Raspberry Pi Pico W via Wi-Fi (it gave a lot of problems), and then we had to create the gui for the game. We created a very good looking 
      game with tkinter, and we created a Desktop Version so it can be played without the circuit. You can select the players and the goalies with a potentiometer.
      It's a very complete game.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bomberman: This was an individual project. I created a bomberman game using python and tkinter. The twist: we had to use recursion, no OOP allowed. It was fun.
    </li>
    <li>
      Paintxel: This was one of the most entertaining projects ever. It was in pairs. We had to create a paint like program, but with pixel art. You can also save 
      and load images from text files. You can do a lot of operations with it. All of it was made using matrices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Personal dotfiles: This is my personal project, this is just my desktop configuration, my biggest project ever lmao.
