  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
  I'm just a curious programmer, i like to build and rebuild stuff. I like contributing to open source code and 
  i always try to open source myself. I always try to keep my github green squares, but sometimes i can't open source 
  my code or i'm working on something else. 

  Apart from coding, i like to play bass, read and listening to music in general. I'm a computer engineering student.
