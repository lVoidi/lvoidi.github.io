# What is this?
I wanted to create a concept website, where i talked about some of my favorite topics, which are mostly related to technology advances. I created a whole concept around black holes since they're my favorite astronomical object, and around technological singularity. I want to explain each part of my web page. https://roarba.com

The Discrete Library
A comprehensive collection of essential algorithms with implementations. This has visualizations, advantages and disadvantages, code examples in three different languages (mostly python, c++ and c# or javascript) of a lot of algorithms.  https://discrete.roarba.com

Technological Singularity
Deep dives into AI and machine learning research papers and developments. Read my opinions and thoughts on different impactful papers. https://singularity.roarba.com

The Pit of Endless Void
Yapping about everything in general. This is my personal opinions dumpster. Sometimes i talk about interesting topics, sometimes i don't. https://void.roarba.com

# Theming 
Currently, the website follows a bloody red theme, based on a Divine Comedy thematic. I follow a dantesque
type of writting. This is because I'm just kind of autistic and i like Dante a little too much.
