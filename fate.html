        <h1>God's final warning</h1>
        <p>
            Space has a beginning, but no end. —Infinite. Stars also have a beginning, but meet and end of their own
            making.
            <br>
            —Finite. History has shown that those with wisdom are the greatest fools of all. The fish that live in the
            sea
            know<br>
            not of the land. If they had wisdom, they too would be destroyed. It is funnier that man shall exceed the
            speed
            of<br>
            light than for fish to start living on land. This can be called God's final warning to those who can
            resist.<br>
