        Space has a beginning, but no end. —Infinite. Stars also have a beginning, but meet and end of their own making.
        <br>
        —Finite. History has shown that those with wisdom are the greatest fools of all. The fish that live in the sea
        know<br>
        not of the land. If they had wisdom, they too would be destroyed. It is funnier that man shall exceed the speed
        of<br>
        light than for fish to start living on land. This can be called God's final warning to those who can resist.<br>
