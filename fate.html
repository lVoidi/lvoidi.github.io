            <h1>God's final warning</h1>
            <p>
                Space has a beginning, but no end. —Infinite. <br> Stars also have a beginning, but meet and end of
                their own
                making.
                —Finite. <br>History has shown that those with wisdom are the greatest fools of all. <br> The fish that
                live
                in
                the
                sea
                know
                not of the land. <br> If they had wisdom, they too would be destroyed. <br>It is funnier that man shall
                exceed
                the
                speed
                of
                light than for fish to start living on land. <br>This can be called God's final warning to those who can
                resist.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point is to change it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't turn a blind eye to the problems around you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be loud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be annoying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be revolutionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or else, history will make fun of you for embracing status quo.
