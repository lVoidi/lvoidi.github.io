                <h1>ChatGPT and image generation</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    ChatGPT is well known by everyone as the most famous AI chatbot out there. It has evolved from a simple chatbot 
                    to an almost general purpose AI. ChatGPT is able to generate text, code, and now images. You could create images 
                    with ChatGPT before using DALL-E, but it wasn't part of the gpt model itself, it was a separate model. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yesterday, OpenAI announced a new feature in ChatGPT. You can now generate images with ChatGPT premium. In this post, 
                    we will discuss this feature, compare it with DALL-E and talk about the future of image generation with AI and it's ethical 
                    implications.
                </p>
                <h2>DALL-E vs ChatGPT Images</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, DALL-E has been out for a while now and it's not that good of a model. You would often find DALL-E hallucinating 
                    and generating images with no sense. One of my favorite examples is asking DALL-E to generate an image of a tutorial for 
                    frying an egg. It is really funny because the steps shown make NO sense. See the image below to see this by yourself:
                    
                    <blockquote> 
                        Prompt: Generate the following image: I want you to make a step by step tutorial on frying an egg. Include text and images. 
                    </blockquote>

                    <img src="../../static/img/void/dalle.png" alt="DALL-E egg"> <br>
                    As you can see, this guide is actual garbage and only contributed to global pollution instead of helping the user. However, 
                    ChatGPT Images does not have this problem. 
                    <blockquote>
                        Prompt: Generate the following image: I want you to make a step by step tutorial on frying an egg. Include text and images. 
                    </blockquote>
                    <img src="../../static/img/void/chatgptimages-egg.png" alt="ChatGPT Images egg"> <br>

                    This guide is actually helpful and looks way better than the DALL-E one. Like, there is no comparison here.
                </p>
                <h2>Weird behaviors</h2>
                <p>
                    Since this feature came out, people have been using it to generate all kinds of images. Because of that, people discovered 
                    really weird behaviors from it. 
                    <h3>Sexy man vs Sexy woman image generation</h3>
                    Something really weird is that if you ask ChatGPT to generate an image of a sexy man, it will generate it, but 
                    if you ask for a sexy woman, it won't. This is really funny because it shows that the model has some kind of 
                    gender bias, and people started making jokes about it and related it with Sam Altman's sexual orientation. 
                </p>
                    <img src="../../static/img/void/sexy-man.png" alt="ChatGPT Images weird">
                
                <p>
                    However, Sam Altman already answered this in twitter. He said that both of them should be allowed and it should be fixed, because 
                    it's a bug.
                </p>
                <h3>Sama's face</h3>
                <p>
                    ChatGPT Images can also behave REALLY strange if you do something related to Sam Altman's face.  
                </p>
                <img src="../../static/img/void/sama-ghibli.png" alt="Sama's face"> <br>
                <img src="../../static/img/void/soulmate.png" alt="Sama's face">
                <h2>Ethical implications of AI generated images</h2>
                <p>
                    This has been a really hot topic since the feature came out. I am talking about the first AI generated images. 
                    At first, it was really easy to differentiate between a real image and an AI generated one. However, now it's not that easy. 
                    These new models keep getting better and better at things like photorealism and artwork. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've seen a lot of people using this to generate deepfake images. Of course this is something that should be taken seriously,
                    imagine what would happen if someone uses your face or your voice to incriminate you, or use your influence, etc. There are 
                    thousands of ways this could go WRONG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artists HATE artificial intelligence. Most of twitter artists, specially graphic designers, painters, etc, are really 
                    against any use of AI in art in general. I am gonna say what I believe and what could happen in the future.
                </p>
                <h3>The obvious: AI is NOT replacing artists</h3>
                <p>
                    From all the jobs i could think of that could be replaced by AI, any art is obviously not one of them. One thing that amazes me 
                    is analyzing what the humans are thinking. We like Van Gogh's paintings because he had his unique style. We like Pink Floyd's 
                    music because it was Pink Floyd, not because certain instruments were played at certain time. Anyone can do that, but the feeling 
                    is what makes the difference. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if AI can generate their own art and music, there will still be a place for human artists. The human touch is what makes 
                    the difference.
                </p>
