                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    It is pretty well known that us, humans, don't like to be bored. Tik Tok, Instagram, Youtube,
                    Twitter/X. We
                    always try to find something to distract us from our reality. Even music. How many of you go for a
                    walk
                    and always have those headphones in? How many of you listen to your fully randomized and big Spotify
                    playlist
                    while you do something?
                    <br>
                    This is the point i will discuss today after a long time of not writting any article. I've been
                    pretty busy
                    with university, giving some classes and doing work. However, I've got some time now and I want
                    to share
                    my thoughts on this topic.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Boredom is Important</h2>
                <img src="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/Images/thumbnail_large_news-phone-scrolling_tcm88-2430376.jpg"
                    alt="Woman scrolling on her phone" class="img-fluid mb-4">
                <p>
                    How much time has passed since you enjoyed the silence? I mean, how long has been since it was
                    <b>just you and your thoughts</b>? We live in a world full of noise. I don't only mean, like, the
                    noise of your city. You might live in a quiet place in that aspect. I mean the noise of
                    your devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, have you asked yourself when was the last time that you were the one that created and
                    not the one that consumed? When was the last time that you really dig into yourself and your
                    OWN thoughts?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some of you, this might even recall to when you were a mere kid. When you made that sand castle
                    and when you asked your mom "what is this" or "what is that". That <b>Kid Curiosity</b> might have
                    died within you when you became an adult, or even before, when you became a teenager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads me to my main point. We don't have time to self discovery. Worded better, we don't
                    really have to when we have constant information blown into our brains. We have it way too easy. Let
                    me
                    do an analogy first to understand my point and how thinking like a kid can make you a way more
                    creative
                    human.
                </p>
                <h3>The Kid Analogy</h3>
                <img src="https://babysparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20273a.jpg" alt="Kid playing with sand">
                <p>
                    When we were kids, we were constantly BORED. What did we do when we were bored? Well, we may had
                    different
                    ways to approach it. Us, zoomers and older generations, we had our toys and we imagined our own epic
                    fight
                    with our own epic story. We may have imagined the drops of rain, in the window of the car, having a
                    legendary
                    race to get to the finish line (the door). We drew our family as a happy stick figures, grabbed by
                    their hands,
                    in front of their square houses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were walking with your parents, mentors, brothers, or any other person, you may have
                    asked them a hell ton of questions about the world that surrounds you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This obviously does not apply for (most) gen alpha kids, because <i>some</i> parents like to just
                    give their kids and iPad and make them watch Cocomelon, which is the absolute worst thing you can
                    do with your kids and, obviously, the fastest way to fry their brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are an adult, you don't have that luxury. You have a job, you have responsabilities, you
                    have bills to pay.
                    But you can use this super power, called <b>The Kid Curiosity</b>, by calling it with one incredible
                    trick: <b>Allowing yourself to be bored</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you, as an adult, get bored, you won't play with toys obviously, some of you may do it by some
                    hobbie, but you can do different stuff. An adult, with their own thoughts alone, is a double edge
                    weapon. You can create amazing things, but you can also fall into the trap of overthinking and
                    spiraling into negative thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you ignore this? Sometimes, you just can't. But enjoying the silence, instead of
                    reaching for your phone or other distractions, can help you reconnect with yourself, can't you? It
                    can help
                    you analyze your situation in a more deeper way and understand YOU.
                    Think by yourself, instead
                    of letting the algorithms of social media do it for you. Create by yourself, instead of consuming
                    mindlessly. Learn by yourself, don't let an algorithm bombard you with random information. Educate
                    yourself about something you're interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may ask yourself "but, what do i create?". Well, if you already became bored and the only
                    thing between you and creating is silence, you can explore your wonderful brain. Some of you
                    may have an affinity for music, so create a melody in your mind, or even better, if you
                    can use an instrument or use a DAW, create it there. If you always liked those drawings
                    of your favorite artist, why not grabbing a pencil, paper and start doing some basic drawings, to
                    discover your own style? If you always liked that writter, let's say Edgar Allan Poe, why don't
                    you try to create your own short stories?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an adult, you have way more power than a child, if you think about it. You have the technique,
                    you can
                    read, draw, listen and understand language, some of you can speak more than one idiom.
                    You have far better tools than
                    a cube and a bunch of sand, you have the entire collection of human knowledge: the internet. You
                    have a far deeper, richer and cosmic understanding of the world, the everything. Make your
                    Kid Curiosity raise and come back to life. Ask yourself questions. How does this work? Why
                    did this character do something at certain point of the story? Why did this artist did
                    the drawing from this perspective? What does these words mean, in these Edgar Allan Poe's poem?
                    What did Charles Chaplin mean in The Great Dictator speech? What was the context when certain
                    thing happened?
                </p>
                <p>
                    These questions can only raise if you have the kid curiosity, even if you aren't consciously
                    aware of it. It is within you. Make it shine. Make it come back to life and explore the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having a stupidly big and randomized playlist of Spotify, start digging into
                    the artists you like. Listen to their albums in their intended order, pay attention to the lyrics
                    and try to interpret them, by your own. After doing that, go on and read the intended meaning of
                    the album and each of the songs. Explore the creative process of their creation, you may find
                    some stupid stuff that you thought were deep, and some deep stuff that you thought were
                    stupid. Your mind will blow and your understanding, not only of music, but of the world, will be
                    expanded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't listen to music mindlessly at every hour of your day. Make it an special moment. This will
                    give the music a higher value than just background noise. Understand the artist feelings, and
                    make them engrave in your heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me remind you something, and the core idea of this article. <b>There is no better sound in this
                        world than the sound of silence</b>. The sound of your own thoughts. The sound of your heart
                    beating.
                    Embrace it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my case, i have a lot of dreams. I have dreams almost every night. What do i do? When i wake up,
                    i write them down in my so called Dream Journal. I write them down in a lot of detail and then i
                    interpret them. I tell them to somebody else. I make my own theories. Some of them just say "Why do
                    you take your dreams so seriously? They are just dreams". But i don't care. I use my imaginations
                    to get creative inspirations. This lets me explore ideas for my own stories, art, and projects, as
                    stupid as it may seem! Dreams are a huge art inspiration, see <a

                </p>
                <h2>Kid Curiosity in Action</h2>
                <p>
                    I am obviously talking about the context of arts, so it is obvious that these fields are inherently
                    creative and expressive. However, you can apply this to engineering, science, math, history,
                    biology,
                    medicine, business, teaching, everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can you use your Kid Curiosity as a university student? Get REALLY bored in class.
                    My first advice is to hide your phone and any electronic device, even tablets. Use bare paper and
                    pencil. Use some colors, also.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since you're out of distractions, you have literally no other choice than pay attention to class. By
                    doing this, you can LITERALLY hack your brain to make you thing that the class is actually
                    interesting
                    and engaging, since the other option is do nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you do this, you can start to ask yourself questions about the topic. How did this happen? Who
                    discovered
                    this? Why would anyone even think about this? How does this relate to my career and why do i have to
                    study it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    See how you automatically start doing THINKING? This is a super power, even if you don't believe it.
                    Just test it and you will see how you start to understand the topic in a deeper, better way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you may even go to your house and do some research about the topic by your own, even
                    if it isn't required by the asignature. This way, you can further enhance your understanding and
                    potentially discover new interests related to the subject. With this method, you can make even
                    the absolute worst class in existence bearable, and even an interesting one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want you to remember something. Well, maybe you don't actually remember it, but when you were a
                    kid,
                    you literally were not afraid of asking questions. You were curious about everything and anything.
                    You wanted to know how things worked, why they were the way they were, and you weren't afraid to
                    speak up and ask for clarification. You were not afraid of asking the "obvious".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want all of you to apply that in your adulthood. Don't be afraid to ask questions, no matter how
                    trivial they may seem. Embrace your curiosity and let it guide you in your learning journey. I am
                    the
                    kind of person who believes that no question is too small or insignificant. So, let's foster a
                    culture
                    of curiosity and open dialogue, where we can all learn from each other and grow together.
                </p>

                    The kid within you always shines, but sometimes you just have to polish it a bit to make it
                    shine brighter. Embrace your curiosity and let it guide you in your learning journey. Don't let
                    your creativity, introspection, and imagination be supressed by distractions. Let the noise
                    be the silence. Use the sound of silence in your favor to become an absolute super human.
