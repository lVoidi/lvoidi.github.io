              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
              I've always been kind of picky with the web browsers i used. At first, i would just use Firefox, as it was kind of 
              an alternative to Google Chrome, which i despised, and the Microsoft Explorer at the time. However, Firefox evolution 
              turned out to be a disaster. Mozilla, in my humble opinion, did a terrible job, specially with <a href="https://medium.com/@mail_18109/mozillas-new-firefox-terms-spark-privacy-concerns-are-users-switching-to-chrome-b6b160e203f6" target="_blank"> their new privacy policy</a>, which 
              turned out to be a complete disaster. However, i didn't make the switch from Firefox for this specially, this is just 
              an example out of many of the terrible decisions Mozilla has made. I first made the switch because the browser turned out 
              to be slower every time i used it, so i first made the switch in 2021, i switched to Microsoft Edge. As stupid as it sounds,
              i didn't really cared about my privacy, i just liked the fact that Microsoft Edge was the most lightweight and customizable 
              browser i used in a while, and i could use it without problems under Linux. So i don't really cared about the privacy, i 
              just wanted my thing to run fast. And it worked for a while. However, over the time i really started worrying about the 
              importance of a private web browser. I started my research, so in this post, i will discuss my decision of migrating from 
              Firefox, Microsoft Edge to Brave Browser.
              </p>
              <h2>Chromium based browsers are better</h2>
              <p>
              This was one of the most important lessons i learned around web browsers. Firefox maxis like to say that their browser is better 
              because it is the only one that is different and not based in chromium. However, this is not an advantage at all. It is proven that 
              chromium based browsers are more <b>secure</b> than Firefox. This does NOT mean that they're all more private, however,
              that is where browsers like Brave come in.  
              </p>
              <p>
              Let's talk about why chromium browsers are more secure. This is because V8 sandbox. Check <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/google-chrome-adds-v8-sandbox-new.html">this</a> and <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">this</a>. Firefox sandbox is way weaker and it makes it easier to exploit. If 
              you think about it, it makes a lot of sense since Mozilla security team is much much smaller than Google one. Also, there is no <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653444">GPU Sandboxing</a>, and also site isolation is not at the same level as Chromium. It's not even close. 
              </p>
              <h2>There are private chromium browsers</h2>
              <p>
              Firefox fans like to say that chromium browsers are all the same and they all collect your data. This is false, really false. Browsers like 
              Brave might use Chromium, but that does NOT make it the same as, for example, Microsoft Edge. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Even though these browsers use the same engine, Chromium, they are really really different. Even firefox uses chromium parts, see <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/ipc">IPC</a> and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox">sandbox</a>.
              </p> 
              <h2>Why Brave?</h2>
              <p>
              Brave Browser is my personal pick from all web browsers. It is not as lightweight as Microsoft Edge, however, it is way more private and secure. 
              Brave Shields is way more secure than using a chromium browser with uBlock Origin. This is because google has done several attempts to make uBO 
              not work. uBlock Origin is well known because it blocks almost all the ads and it is a threat to youtube advertisement, since it blocks it all. 
              That's why uBlock Origin is not that good of an option in chromium browsers, since google wants to get rid of it SO bad. This obviously does not 
              happen in mozilla firefox, since they do not care if the users are blocking youtube advertisement. This is an argument firefox lovers use 
              frequently, however, there is an alternatives. Brave Shields is proven to work as good as uBlock Origin and, even doing some things that 
              uBO can't. For example, <a href="https://x.com/gnukeith/status/1873917518311567558">brave shields can blocks network requests from extensions, which uBO cannot do as an extension</a>. You can see that tweet for more examples of why Brave is so good. 
              </p>
              <h2>Browser thing is mostly personal preferences</h2>
              <p>
              Something i learned is that browser thing is mostly based in your personal liking. Some people prefer using Microsoft Edge because it integrates
              really well with Microsoft products. Some other like to use Firefox because it is not chromium. There are many reasons why you would prefer 
              some browsers than others. In my opinion, Brave suits my personal preferences, it is private, secure, fast and is chromium. That is more than 
              enough for me. 
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
              Choose the browser you prefer. I told my reasons of why i prefer Brave, but your reasons are mostly valid.
