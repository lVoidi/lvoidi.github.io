                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been exploring the world of blockchain for a year now, and i've tried many blockchains. First of all, i 

                    tried ethereum, i went to a CTF (capture the flag) and it was really interesting. The CTF was called "CTF Pura Vida"
                    and it was the first blockchain CTF here in Costa Rica. I was able to participate with my friend and we won absolutely nothing.
                    It was fun tho, and we were really close.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the blockchains we explored in that CTF were Ethereum and Starknet. Starknet was really interesting but i felt 
                    dissapointed with Ethereum. I felt like it was a little bit too slow and the gas fees were too high. I know we were working 
                    in the testnet and it might be different in the mainnet, but i just felt that way. It also felt sloppy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even with that problems, i still loved Ethereum and invested in it. I bought Ethereum in 2024 when it was around 3200 USD and 
                    it went up to 3800 USD. I didn't sell because i thought it was going to go higher. I was wrong. Ethereum literally 
                    behaved like a stablecoin. It didn't grow at all. I was really disappointed. I sold my Ethereum at loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, i started to explore other blockchains. I tried Solana and i really liked it, however, uptime was not one if 
                    its features. That's when i started to search for alternatives to Solana.
                </p>
                <h2>Sui</h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered Sui when i was exploring Binance. I saw a coin called Sui that had recently hit 1.7$ and it was growing really fast. 
                    I explored the documentation, and saw info and read the technical paper. I was really impressed. Sui was the fastest blockchain i've 
                    ever met at that point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only that, price action was really good. It was growing really fast and it was really volatile. It had a lot of volume. I bought 
                    instantly. I was really happy when sui got to $5 recently. I already talked about Sui technology deeply in my singularity post. 
                    You can read it <a href="../../singularity/pages/sui-whitepaper.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am just in love with Sui. Community is really good, and developers are really building something over it. Most of investors are also 
                    bullish about it, because Sui is really promising not only as an speculative asset, but also as a technology. 
                </p>
                <h2>I just love Sui community</h2>
                <p>
                    I've never seen a community so active and so supportive. Even memecoins here look like they are really building something. Some of 
                    my favorite memecoins are $SOG, $SUIYAN and $BLUB. These coins are completely natural and are managed by the community, people doing 
                    it for the love of the game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've already talked about my experience with $SUIYAN in my <a href="../../singularity/pages/sui-whitepaper.html" target="_blank">technical analysis</a>. 
                    Memecoins are really strong, even though we are living some kind of winter right now because of some memecoins that came out in trump inauguration like 
                    $TRUMP and $MELANIA, they are still standing strong and community is still active.
                </p>
                <h2>Developer experience</h2>
                <p>
                    The developer experience is also really good and it's getting better. Sui has a really good documentation and Move is a really good language for 
                    smart contracts. With Solana, you would have to setup a whole rust environment to start developing. With Sui, you can start developing 
                    with just installing sui cli and you are good to go. 
                </p>

            <p>
            In conclusion, Sui stands out as a leading blockchain platform due to its innovative features and robust architecture, and that's why i like it so much.
             The Move programming language ensures type safety and access control, while cryptographic guarantees provide transaction 
             certificates and light client support. Additionally, Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms enhance the security and reliability of the network. 
             These attributes collectively make Sui a powerful and secure blockchain solution, capable of supporting a wide range of applications and use cases.
