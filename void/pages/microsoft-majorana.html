                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    So i was scrolling through my twitter feed and i saw a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1892242895094313420">Satya Nadella</a>. 
                    But it really caught my attention at first glance. Let's read what he said:
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h3>Satya Nadella</h3>
                        <p>
                            "A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...

Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.

After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we've created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.

It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.

We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.

The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller.

They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor.

Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not!

Sometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.

It takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world.

And I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft.

This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.

It's not about hyping tech; it's about building technology that truly serves the world."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    Yeah, you read that right. Microsoft says they have created a new state of matter. It really caught my attention because i 
                    didn't even know it was possible to CREATE a new state of matter. I know that there are some states of matter like 
                    bose-einstein condensade, which require extreme conditions like cold temperatures close to absolute zero, but i never 
                    thought it was possible to create a new one artificially. I really want to talk about this, but i don't know where to start.
                    So let's dive into the details.
                </p>
                <h2>The chip</h2>
                <p>
                    So i read the whole <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/">article</a> 
                    featuring the Majorana 1 chip, and i must say, it's a really interesting read. I am going to summarize the most important parts, but if you 
                    want to get into more details, read it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chip is called Majorana 1 and it is a quantum processor built on a topological core. It is made of a material called 
                    topoconductor, which features the so called new state of matter. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So what exactly is this new state of matter? It's not solid, liquid, or gas—it's a topological state. Microsoft has engineered 
                    special materials that can create this state, which enables them to produce more reliable qubits (quantum bits) for quantum 
                    computing. It sounds like science fiction, but it's actually happening now!
                </p>

                <h2>Why is this a big deal?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me break this down in simpler terms. Current quantum computers are incredibly powerful but also extremely fragile. 
                    Their qubits are like the most sensitive musical instruments you can imagine—the slightest disturbance from 
                    the environment can make them lose their quantum properties. This makes scaling them up really difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Microsoft claims that their topological qubits are fundamentally different. They're more stable by design, meaning they're naturally 
                    protected from errors. This is because the quantum information is stored in Majorana particles (named after physicist Ettore Majorana) 
                    that have this weird property of hiding information in a way that makes it resistant to disruption.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's even more impressive is the scale they're talking about. They're saying they can fit a million qubits on a single chip small 
                    enough to hold in your hand! This is mind-blowing when you consider that today's most advanced quantum computers have only 
                    a few hundred qubits at most.
                </p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>Quick Science Tidbit</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Majorana particles that Microsoft is using don't even exist in nature. They had to create special conditions using 
                        indium arsenide and aluminum materials, extreme cold temperatures, and magnetic fields to coax these exotic particles 
                        into existence! These scientists are basically playing with the fabric of reality.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>What can we do with this technology?</h2>
                <p>
                    This is where things get really interesting. Microsoft says that with a million-qubit quantum computer, we could tackle 
                    problems that all of today's classical computers combined couldn't solve. We're talking about:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Creating self-healing materials that could repair cracks in bridges, airplane parts, or even your shattered phone screen</li>
                    <li>Developing catalysts that could break down different types of plastics and microplastics into valuable byproducts</li>
                    <li>Engineering enzymes to boost soil fertility, potentially helping with global hunger issues</li>
                    <li>Designing new medications with unprecedented precision</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The most mind-blowing part? Microsoft is saying this is possible in years, not decades. They're already one of only two companies 
                    to advance to the final phase of DARPA's program aimed at creating quantum computers with real commercial utility.
                </p>

                <h2>How does it actually work?</h2>
                <p>
                    As a computer engineer, I find the architecture fascinating. The quantum chip has aluminum nanowires arranged in an H-pattern. 
                    Each H contains four controllable Majorana particles and makes up one qubit. These H patterns can be connected and tiled across 
                    the chip like a quantum game of Tetris.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What's really clever is that they've figured out how to control these qubits digitally—basically like flipping a light switch—rather 
                    than the ultra-precise analog tuning that other quantum computers need. This makes scaling so much more practical.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The materials also had to be designed atom by atom. As Microsoft technical fellow Krysta Svore explained, "We are literally spraying 
                    atom by atom. Those materials have to line up perfectly. If there are too many defects in the material stack, it just kills your qubit."
                </p>

                <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm genuinely excited about this breakthrough. If Microsoft really has created a reliable and scalable quantum architecture, we 
                    could see quantum computing transform from an academic curiosity to a practical technology within our lifetime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's a beautiful irony in Microsoft's approach too: they're building a quantum computer to help solve complex materials 
                    science problems... and they need those solutions to build better quantum computers! Svore put it perfectly: "With a scaled 
                    quantum computer, we will be able to predict materials with even better properties for building the next generation of 
                    quantum computers beyond scale."
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's a reminder that the most significant technological breakthroughs often come from taking the harder, less traveled path. 
                    Microsoft spent nearly 20 years pursuing topological qubits while others focused on more immediately accessible approaches. 
                    That patience and persistence might have just paid off in a really big way. You can read the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/">microsoft article</a>
